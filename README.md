## 📦 Data Preparation

Download the required datasets from the following link:

- [UDF & Sketch Data](https://pan.baidu.com/) (Password: `6khe`)

### 🔹 UDF Data

Refer to the [UDiFF repository](https://github.com/weiqi-zhang/UDiFF/tree/main) to generate UDF fields from DeepFashion or your own data.

### 🔹 Sketch Data

Please refer to `prepare_sketch.py` for sketch data preprocessing instructions.

## 🚀 Training & Inference

### 🎯 Stage 1: Base Diffusion Model

**Training:**

```bash
bash scripts/train.sh
```

**Inference:**

```bash
bash scripts/generate.sh
```

---

### ✨ Stage 2: Subdivision Diffusion Model

**Training:**

```bash
bash scripts/train_super.sh
```

**Inference:**

```bash
bash scripts/generate_super.sh
```

> 📁 **Note:** All scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory. You can customize configurations by editing these scripts.

## 🎨 Texture Generation

We recommend using [SyncMVD](https://github.com/LIU-Yuxin/SyncMVD) for high-quality texture generation.

### Step 1: Clone the SyncMVD Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LIU-Yuxin/SyncMVD.git
cd SyncMVD
```

### Step 2: Environment Setup

Follow the installation and setup instructions provided in the SyncMVD repository.

### Step 3: Texture Inference

Use SyncMVD with the mesh outputs (located in `./output/`) generated by our model.
