## 🎨 Texture Generation

We recommend using [SyncMVD](https://github.com/LIU-Yuxin/SyncMVD) for high-quality texture generation.

### Step 1: Clone the SyncMVD Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LIU-Yuxin/SyncMVD.git
cd SyncMVD
```

### Step 2: Environment Setup

Follow the installation and setup instructions provided in the SyncMVD repository.

### Step 3: Texture Inference

Use SyncMVD with the mesh outputs (located in `output/`) generated by our model.
